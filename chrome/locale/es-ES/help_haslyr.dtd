<!ENTITY haslyr.addon.firstpoint "When LyricMaster is installed, it will install a column in the user's library that will show whether a track has lyrics.  The column is labeled 'Lyrics' and will display an icon if the track has lyrics.  When lyrics are fetched with batch functionality, edited with the track editor, tracks are added to the library, or when saved when shown in the display pane, the action will clear or set the icon appropriately.">
<!ENTITY haslyr.addon.secpoint "If the library is already established before LyricMaster is installed, LyricMaster can be set to scan the entire library to properly set the 'Has Lyrics' icon by going into the preferences for LyricMaster and selecting the 'Scan entire library...' button.  Depending on the size of the library and the speed of the computer, this operation could take a bit of time.">
